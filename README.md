# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a classic Tic Tac Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed for two players who take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid with X and O. The main goal is to get three of your marks in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally — before your opponent does.
